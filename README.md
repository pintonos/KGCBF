# Knowledge Graph Curation Benchmark Framework (KGCBF)

Framework for evaluating correction and completion approaches.

For correction it injects specific semantic and syntactic errors into Knowledge graphs. For completion different links are removed. These changes are recorded and after the approach corrected / completed the KG the evaluation module looks up the changed triples and evaluates their correctness.
